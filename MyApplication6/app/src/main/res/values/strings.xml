        Teachers work in public or private childcare centers, elementary and high schools, and postsecondary schools. Some teachers also work online from their home office or find employment in corporate training. Many teachers work a portion of the year, enjoying an extended break during summers. Most school systems also provide extended breaks around holidays.
